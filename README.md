# Hi there! 👋
I'm **Marc Casanova**, a software engineer and passionate gamer.  

I'm currently at the final stages of a master's degree in AAA videogame programming in the UPC, where we are developing a custom engine and a game on top of it. I also have a Software Engineering degree in UB, where I learnt loads of other technologies and languages like Python, Java, NoSQL, VR, etc.

I love creating and exploring video games, watching series, anime, and movies. 🎮📺🍿

I am planning a personal project to build a video game in Unreal Engine to further expand my knowledge and gain experience with GAS.
